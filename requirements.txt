# FastAPI Headless Attendance System Requirements
# Production-optimized for CPU with ONNX Runtime

# FastAPI and dependencies
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
pydantic

# ONNX Runtime for CPU (10x faster than TensorFlow on CPU)
onnxruntime
insightface  # Uses SCRFD (detection) + ArcFace (recognition) ONNX models

# OpenVINO for Intel CPU acceleration (optional but recommended)
openvino  # Provides OpenVINOExecutionProvider for ONNX

# Core dependencies (NO TensorFlow - pure ONNX for speed)
opencv-python
opencv-contrib-python  # For additional CV algorithms

# Image processing
numpy
Pillow
scikit-image  # For image quality checks

# Data processing
pandas

# Scientific computing (for cosine similarity in custom vector DB)
scipy

# Utilities
requests

# Logging and monitoring
colorlog  # For colored console logs
python-json-logger  # For structured logging

# Performance optimization
numba  # JIT compilation for numpy operations

# Anti-spoofing / Liveness detection
imutils  # Image utilities
dlib  # Facial landmark detection (optional, for blink detection)

# Note: Uses custom SQLite-based vector database (no ChromaDB needed)
# Note: Uses built-in SQLite3 (no external DB needed)
